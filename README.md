# Laser-D Documentation Source

The Laser-D documentation sources are in the `src` folder.

To build the documentation, you will need Python and [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) installed.

Assuming Python and Sphinx are available, you can build the docs as follows.

```
cd src
make html
```
